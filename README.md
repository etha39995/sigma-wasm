### Babylon WFC - Wave Function Collapse 3D (`/babylon-wfc`)

A 3D visualization of the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, a procedural generation technique that creates coherent patterns from a set of rules. This demo showcases 11 different tile types rendered in 3D using BabylonJS with mesh instancing for optimal performance.

**Technology Stack:**
- Rust/WASM for WFC algorithm implementation
- BabylonJS for 3D rendering
- Mesh instancing for performance optimization

- 11 distinct tile types: Grass, Floor, 4 Wall directions, 4 Corner types, and Door
- 3D visualization with interactive camera controls
- Mesh instancing for efficient rendering of 2500 tiles
- Babylon 2D UI buttons for recompute and fullscreen
- **Text-to-Layout Generation**: Enter natural language prompts (e.g., "sparse buildings", "dense clustered layout") to guide WFC generation
- Real-time procedural generation

**WASM Module:** `wasm-babylon-wfc`

**Tile Types:**
1. Grass
2. Floor
3. Wall (North)
4. Wall (South)
5. Wall (East)
6. Wall (West)
7. Corner (NE)
8. Corner (NW)
9. Corner (SE)
10. Corner (SW)
11. Door/Entrance

**WFC Algorithm Deep Dive:**

The Wave Function Collapse algorithm is a constraint-based procedural generation technique inspired by quantum mechanics. Each cell starts in a "superposition" of all possible tile types, then collapses to a single state based on constraints from neighboring cells.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Superposition**: Each cell maintains a list of possible tile types (the "wave function"). Initially, all 11 tile types are possible for non-grass cells.

2. **Entropy**: The number of possible tile types for a cell. Lower entropy means fewer possibilities, making the cell more "certain" about its final state. The algorithm always collapses the cell with the lowest entropy first to minimize contradictions.

3. **Constraint Propagation**: When a cell is collapsed to a specific tile type, its edges define what neighboring cells can be. For example:
   - A `WallNorth` tile has a `Floor` edge on its south side (interior)
   - This means the cell to the south can only be tiles with a `Floor` edge on their north side
   - All incompatible tile types are removed from the neighbor's wave function
   - This propagation continues recursively to all affected neighbors

4. **Edge Compatibility Rules**: Each tile type has four edges (North, South, East, West), and each edge has a type (`Empty`, `Wall`, `Floor`, `Grass`, `Door`). Tiles can only be adjacent if their shared edges match:
   - `WallNorth` (South=Floor) can connect to `Floor` (North=Floor) or `Door` (North=Floor)
   - `WallNorth` (North=Empty) connects to exterior space (grass or empty)
   - Walls can be adjacent in the same direction (e.g., multiple `WallNorth` tiles in a row) but not in opposite directions (preventing double-thick walls)

5. **Pre-Constraints**: Before WFC begins, certain cells can be "pre-collapsed" to specific tile types. This is used for:
   - Grass regions (via Voronoi noise)
   - Text-to-layout generation (user-specified constraints)
   - Building seeds (for guided generation)

**Two-Phase Generation:**

- **Phase 1 - Voronoi Grass Generation**: 
  - Generates 10 seed points randomly across the 50×50 grid
  - Each cell is assigned to the region of its closest seed point
  - Creates natural-looking, irregular grass patches
  - Grass cells are pre-collapsed before WFC begins
  - This prevents large uniform green quadrants and adds visual variety

- **Phase 2 - WFC Collapse**: 
  - All non-grass cells start in superposition (all 11 tile types possible)
  - Grass cells are already collapsed, so their constraints propagate immediately
  - Algorithm loop:
    1. Find the uncollapsed cell with lowest entropy
    2. If multiple cells have the same lowest entropy, pick randomly
    3. Collapse the cell to a random valid tile type from its possibilities
    4. Propagate constraints to all neighbors (remove incompatible tiles)
    5. Repeat until all cells are collapsed
  - If a cell has 0 valid possibilities (contradiction), it falls back to `Floor`
  - After the loop, any remaining uncollapsed cells are filled with `Floor` to prevent gaps

**Text-to-Layout Workflow (TileGPT-Inspired):**

This feature combines natural language understanding with constraint-based generation, inspired by the [TileGPT paper](https://tilegpt.github.io/).

1. **User Input**: User enters a text prompt (e.g., "sparse buildings", "dense clustered layout", "many small buildings")

2. **Qwen Chat Model Generation**:
   - Uses `Xenova/qwen1.5-0.5b-chat` (a chat-optimized model, better at instruction following than base models)
   - Chat template format enables structured output
   - Generates a JSON description with:
     - `buildingDensity`: "sparse" | "medium" | "dense" (controls number of buildings)
     - `clustering`: "clustered" | "distributed" | "random" (controls spatial distribution)
     - `grassRatio`: number between 0.0-1.0 (percentage of grid that should be grass)
     - `buildingSizeHint`: "small" | "medium" | "large" (hint for building dimensions)

3. **Constraint Parsing**:
   - First attempts JSON parsing (chat models are better at structured output)
   - Falls back to regex pattern matching if JSON parsing fails
   - Defaults to reasonable values if parsing completely fails

4. **Pre-Constraint Conversion**:
   - **Grass Regions**: Uses Voronoi-like algorithm with density based on `grassRatio`
   - **Building Seeds**: Places building seed points based on `buildingDensity` and `clustering`:
     - Clustered: Groups buildings into clusters
     - Distributed: Spreads buildings evenly
     - Random: Places buildings randomly
   - Seeds are converted to `Floor` tile pre-constraints

5. **WFC Generation**: WFC algorithm runs with pre-constraints applied, generating a detailed layout that respects the high-level constraints

6. **3D Visualization**: BabylonJS renders the result with color-coded tiles and interactive camera controls

**Why Qwen Chat Model?**

Unlike base language models (like DistilGPT-2), Qwen is a chat model specifically fine-tuned for:
- **Better instruction following**: Understands and follows structured prompts more reliably
- **Structured output**: More likely to generate valid JSON when requested
- **Contextual understanding**: Better at interpreting nuanced layout descriptions
- **Chat template format**: Uses proper message formatting for more reliable responses

This makes it ideal for converting natural language into structured constraint data.

**Visual Features:**
- **Color Coding**: Grass (green), Floor (gray), Walls (brown), Corners (dark gray), Door (orange)
- **Camera**: Initially centered on grid with optimal viewing angle
- **Interactive**: Mouse controls for rotation and zoom

**Key Files:**
- Route: [`src/routes/babylon-wfc.ts`](src/routes/babylon-wfc.ts)
- Rust Source: [`wasm-babylon-wfc/src/lib.rs`](wasm-babylon-wfc/src/lib.rs)
- HTML: [`pages/babylon-wfc.html`](pages/babylon-wfc.html)

The WFC algorithm ensures that tiles are placed according to edge compatibility rules, creating visually coherent patterns. The 3D visualization uses BabylonJS mesh instancing to efficiently render thousands of tiles while maintaining smooth performance.

**Architecture Patterns:**

This project demonstrates several important patterns for Rust WASM integration:

1. **State Management Pattern** (`LazyLock<Mutex<State>>`):
   ```rust
   static STATE: LazyLock<Mutex<State>> = LazyLock::new(|| Mutex::new(State::new()));
   ```
   - **Why?**: WASM modules are stateless by default, but many algorithms need mutable state
   - **Learning Point**: `LazyLock` provides thread-safe lazy initialization, `Mutex` ensures safe concurrent access
   - **Trade-off**: Mutex adds overhead but enables safe shared state in WASM

2. **WASM-JS Interop Pattern**:
   - TypeScript interfaces define expected WASM exports
   - Runtime validation ensures type safety without type assertions
   - Dynamic imports with validation before use
   - **Learning Point**: Never trust dynamic imports - always validate at runtime

3. **Route Handler Pattern**:
   - Each endpoint has: route handler (TS) + HTML page + WASM module
   - Lazy loading: WASM modules only load when route is accessed
   - Error handling: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
   - **Learning Point**: Separation of concerns makes code maintainable and testable

4. **Type Safety Patterns**:
   - Discriminated unions for tile types and edge types
   - Type guards instead of type assertions
   - Runtime validation before type narrowing
   - **Learning Point**: TypeScript's type system is powerful but requires discipline to use effectively

### WASM Modules Organization

The project uses a Rust workspace with multiple WASM crates, each compiled independently:

- `wasm-astar`: Pathfinding algorithm and game state management
- `wasm-preprocess`: Image preprocessing for SmolVLM-500M (224×224)
- `wasm-preprocess-256m`: Image preprocessing for SmolVLM-256M (512×512)

- `wasm-fractal-chat`: Fractal generation algorithms
- `wasm-hello`: Student template demonstrating WASM state management
- `wasm-babylon-wfc`: Wave Function Collapse algorithm for procedural generation

Each module is built using `wasm-bindgen` and optimized with `wasm-opt` for smaller binary sizes.

### Routing System

The application uses a client-side router (`src/main.ts`) that:
- Detects the current pathname
- Lazy-loads the appropriate route handler
- Initializes the corresponding WASM module and UI
- Handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

Routes are defined in `src/main.ts` and each route has:
- A TypeScript route handler (`src/routes/*.ts`)
- An HTML page (`pages/*.html`)
- A corresponding WASM module

### Model Loading Strategies

**ONNX Runtime Models (SmolVLM):**
- Models are downloaded from Hugging Face
- Cached using the Cache API for faster subsequent loads
- CORS proxies are used when direct access fails
- Progress tracking during download and initialization

**Transformers.js Models:**
- Models are loaded on-demand via Transformers.js
- Automatic quantization and optimization
- WebAssembly acceleration for inference
- Model files are cached by the browser

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation if models fail to load
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Fallback to preprocessing-only mode when models unavailable
